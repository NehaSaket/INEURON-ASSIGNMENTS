    "Ans- (i) ‘/’ & ‘//’ Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"/\" (Division Operator): This operator is used for performing division between two numbers. It results in a floating-point (decimal) number, even if the division is between two integers. For example, 10 / 3 would result in 3.333....\n",
    "\n",
    "\"//\" (Floor Division Operator): This operator is used for performing division between two numbers, but it discards the fractional part and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result. It effectively performs integer division. For example, 10 // 3 would result in 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)  ‘**’ & ‘^’ Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**\" (Exponentiation Operator): This operator is used to raise a number to a power. For example, 2 ** 3 would result in 8, as it calculates 2 raised to the power of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"^\" (Bitwise XOR Operator): In Python, the ^ operator is used as a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on the individual bits of two integers. For example, if you have a = 5 and b = 3, a ^ b would result in 6 because the binary representation of 5 is 0101 and the binary representation of 3 is 0011, and the XOR operation results in 0110, which is 6 in decimal."
