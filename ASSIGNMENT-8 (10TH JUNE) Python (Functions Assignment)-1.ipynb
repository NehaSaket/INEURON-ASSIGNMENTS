    "Ans- In Python, the concepts of \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference\" can be a bit nuanced, as the way arguments are passed to functions in Python is slightly different from some other programming languages. Python uses a mechanism that is often called \"pass by object reference\" or \"call by sharing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pass by Value: In a \"pass by value\" scenario, the actual value of a variable is passed to a function. This means that any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function. This is how primitive types like integers and floats are often passed in languages like C or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pass by Reference: In a \"pass by reference\" scenario, a reference to the original variable is passed to the function. Changes made to the parameter inside the function directly affect the original variable outside the function. This is common with complex data structures like arrays in languages like C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a mechanism that is more accurately described as \"pass by object reference\" or \"call by sharing.\" When you pass an argument to a function, you are passing a reference to the object, not the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the distinction between \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference\" becomes less important in Python due to its memory model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Immutable Objects: Immutable objects like integers, strings, and tuples are effectively passed by value. Any changes made to these objects inside the function do not affect the original objects outside the function. This might make it seem like Python uses \"pass by value\" for these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mutable Objects: Mutable objects like lists and dictionaries are effectively passed by reference. Changes made to these objects inside the function will affect the original objects outside the function. This might make it seem like Python uses \"pass by reference\" for these types.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the key point is that even though changes to mutable objects can be seen outside the function, you can't replace the entire object with a new one and expect the change to be reflected outside the function. If you reassign a mutable object to a new instance inside the function, the change will not be visible outside the function."
